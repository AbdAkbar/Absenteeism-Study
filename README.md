# Absenteeism-Study
A study of factors leading to workplace absenteeism.

The dataset was used in academic research at the Universidade Nove de Julho - Postgraduate Program in Informatics and Knowledge Management.
There are 740 total instances; I have randomly selected 700 instances for model construction and application. The remaining 40 instances will be used for data visualization.

Once preprocessing is completed, a logistic regression is fitted on the training data and then tested; I've used an 80/20 train/test split. Once the model is finalizedm it is exported in a Python module, for use on the visualization dataset. Conclusions from this data are presented in Tableau.
